# Real-TIme-Facial-Emotion-Detection

A collaborative final-year project that uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize human emotions from facial expressions in real time.

## 👨‍💻 Project Overview

We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying human emotions using dynamic facial expressions. The system uses transfer learning on the fully connected layers of a pretrained CNN model, fine-tuned for human emotion classification.

The model was trained using a mix of publicly available datasets and a custom image dataset curated by our team. We achieved a training accuracy of 75% and test accuracy of 60%.

The system captures live video input, detects faces in each frame using OpenCV, and classifies the emotional state of each detected face in real time.
